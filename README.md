Well, 1995 year is so far.. I don't remember history of most things that lie here.
The only thing I remember is that these MDA-russification TSRs where my first & last
seriouse work with assembler. 

The only things changed:
1. this software is free under GNU GPL. (fun that it wasn't :) )
2. my contact coordinates removed (fun if you really need them. ;) )
